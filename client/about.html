            <h1>About Online Acquire</h1>
            <p>This site is an online version of Sid Sackson's Acquire board game. You can create an account (or log in as a guest)
                and play with other people online.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Gameplay is based on this version of the official <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Acquire(MonarchAH).PDF">rules</a>, with the following exceptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No special rules are applied to 2-player games.</li>
                <li>Tiles that become "dead" (would merge safe chains), while in a player's hand are not replaced. If a player draws a dead tile, it is replaced in the manner described in the above rules.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Quitting</h4>
            <p>A common complaint with multiplayer computer Acquire is quitters. In Acquire there is no resigning, if one
            player leaves the game abruptly, it ruins the game for the other players, as there is no obvious way to distribute 
            the quitting player's tiles and shares without messing up other players' plans and strategies.<br><br>
            <b>Solution:</b> On this site, games are timed. If a user's time runs out before they make a play, a (dumb)
             computer player will play for them. This way, if you leave in the middle of a game, the dumb computer will continue to play for you,
             so you will likely lose, but the other players can continue their game uninterupted.</p>
            <h2>Chat</h2>
            <p>You can use the chat box to send messages to other players. You
                can <i>mention</i> other players (type: <span class=highlighted>@example_username my message...</span>) to send them a highlighted message, wherever they are.
                If you are in a game, you can use <span class=highlighted>@lobby</span> to send a message to the lobby.
                You can also use <span class=highlighted>@everyone</span> to send a message everywhere on the site. Don't overuse @everyone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example use of @lobby: <span class=highlighted>@lobby Game5 needs 3 more players!</span></li>
                    <li>Example use of @everyone: <span class=highlighted>@everyone Don't play with @malicious_user, he wastes time on purpose.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can also <i>mute</i> other players (type: <span class=highlighted>/mute example_username</span>), to not see their messages. 
                You can <span class=highlighted>/mute everyone</span> to hide all player messages, <span class=highlighted>/mute lobby</span> to not see lobby messages while in a game, or
                <span class=highlighted>/mute server</span> to hide server messages. Type <span class=highlighted>/unmute example_username</span> to revert the mute.
            </p>
